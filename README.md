## Adam here - thanks for visiting ðŸ‘‹

Currently - I'm in the lab ðŸ§ª building tools on top of LLMs.

I'm working on two things in particular:
- driving web browsers to build data sets from sources that are too messy for traditional scraping tools (WIP example: [phdlist.ai](https://phdlist.ai/)).
- game creation tools with a balance of prebuilt structure and room for an LLM to make edits

My Preferred Stacks:
#### Web
Backend: Node.js, NGINX, usually hosted on DigitalOcean
Web: Typescript, React, Tailwind, Zustand, Next.js if it's a website, Vite and ReactRouter if it's a CSA.

#### Games and Mobile
iOS: SwiftUI, RealityKit, Firebase
games: Godot Game Engine
visionOS: SwiftUI + [GodotVision](https://github.com/kevinw/GodotVision)
