## Adam here - thanks for visiting ðŸ‘‹

Currently - I'm in the lab ðŸ§ª building tools on top of LLMs.

I'm working on two things in particular:
- driving web browsers to build data sets from sources that are too messy for traditional scraping tools (WIP example: [phdlist.ai](https://phdlist.ai/)).
- game creation tools with the right balance of prebuilt structure and room for an LLM to make edits ([basically - a V2 of this game I shipped with my brother](https://www.tiktok.com/@multijam.app))

Some of what I've worked on in the past:
- games - Godot, SwiftUI
- mobile creative tools - SwiftUI, Scenekit
- many many websites
