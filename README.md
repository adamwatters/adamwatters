## Adam here - thanks for visiting ðŸ‘‹

Engineer / Designer / Game Dev
Web, iOS, visionOS, Godot

Currently in the lab ðŸ§ª building tools on top of LLMs.

Working on two things in particular:
- driving web browsers to build data sets from sources that are too messy for traditional scraping tools (WIP example: [phdlist.ai](https://phdlist.ai/)).
- game creation tools with a balance of prebuilt structure and room for an LLM to make edits.

Made [GodotVision](https://github.com/kevinw/GodotVision) (build visionOS games using Godot Game Engine) with [kevinw](https://github.com/kevinw) and [gave a talk about it](https://youtu.be/epozPDvRqfQ?si=l4cGYmjJpYoZj0DY&t=1588)
