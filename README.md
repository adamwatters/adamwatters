## Adam here - thanks for visiting ðŸ‘‹

Engineer / Designer / Game Dev

Currently - I'm in the lab ðŸ§ª building tools on top of LLMs.

I'm working on two things in particular:
- driving web browsers to build data sets from sources that are too messy for traditional scraping tools (WIP example: [phdlist.ai](https://phdlist.ai/)).
- game creation tools with a balance of prebuilt structure and room for an LLM to make edits.
---
tech-stack agnostic, but if you're curious:

#### Web
- Backend: Node.js behind NGINX, usually hosted on DigitalOcean. Recently, Supabase. 
- Frontend: Typescript, React, ReactRouter, Tailwind, Zustand, Vite... Next.js if it's website-y

#### Games & Mobile
- iOS: SwiftUI, RealityKit, Firebase
- games: Godot Game Engine
- visionOS: SwiftUI + [GodotVision](https://github.com/kevinw/GodotVision)
